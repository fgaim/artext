# Artext: Artificial Text Generation
### Probabilistic Noisig of Natural Languages

Artext is a work on intentionally injecting noise into text without affecting the text's core meaning to human reader.
This kind of data can be useful for many NLP tasks, particulary to make models robust to erroneous text. 
This is a work in progress, we will publish the results of our experiments soon.
Meanwhile, if you use `artext` in your research please cite this repository.

```
Note: Noising will generally increase the vocabulary size, as it introduces word inflections and spelling variations.
Therefore use with caution specially when the target models are neural networks.
```


## Setup
Python >= v. 3.5

```
Install required packages.
```


## Usage

Generate sentence or document level noisy samples for a text file using `inject.py` as follows.  
Use `-h` to show all options.
```
python inject.py -src source.txt -out output.txt -l sent -er 0.5 -n 10 -sep '|||'
```


## Examples


```
python test.py -er 0.5 -n 20
```
