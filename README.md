# Artext: Artificial Text Generation
### Probabilistic Noising of Natural Language

Artext is a work on injecting noise into text without affecting the its core meaning to a human reader.
This kind of data can be useful for many NLP tasks, particulary to make models robust to erroneous text. 
This is a work in progress, we will publish the results of our experiments soon.
Meanwhile, if you use `artext` in your research please cite this repository.

```
Note: Noising will generally increase the vocabulary size, as it introduces word inflections 
and spelling variations. Therefore, use it with caution, especially when the target models are
closed vocabulary neural networks.
```


## Setup

Developed and tested with `Python 3.6`.  

Using `pip`:
```
pip install artext
```

[or] from source repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/fgaim/artext
cd artext
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

Install required resources:
```
python -m spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
python -m nltk.download('punckt')
```


## Usage

#### Use from command-line
Generate sentence or document level noisy samples for a text file follows.
Use `-h` to show all options.
```
python -m artext -src source.txt -out output.txt -l sent -er 0.5 -n 10
```

[or] From source code using `inject.py` as follows.
```
python inject.py -src source.txt -out output.txt -l sent -er 0.5 -n 10
```

#### Use programmatically
```python
from artext import Artext

artxt = Artext()
artxt.samples = 5
sent = 'This is a sample sentence, to be noised.'
noises = artxt.noise_sentence(sent)
print(noises)
```

## Examples


```
python test.py -er 0.5 -n 20
```
