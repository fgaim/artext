## Probabilistic Noising of Natural Language

Artext is a work on injecting noise into text without affecting the core meaning for a human reader.
This kind of data can be useful for many NLP tasks, particulary in making models robust to noisy/erroneous input.


This is a work in progress, and the result of our experiments we will published soon.
Meanwhile, if you use `artext` in your research please cite this repository.

> Note: Noising will generally increase the vocabulary size of the data sets, as it introduces word inflections and orthographic variations that may not have existed before. Therefore, use it with caution, especially for closed-vocabulary neural network models such as machine translation. Consider using subword based vocabulary (`BPE` for instance) in such scenarios.



## Setup

`artext`'s developed and tested with `Python 3.6` and can be installed in two ways:

1. Using `pip`:

```
 pip install artext
 ```

2. From source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/fgaim/artext
cd artext
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

Get required resources:
```bash
python -m spacy download 'en_core_web_sm'
python -m nltk.downloader 'punkt'
python -m nltk.downloader 'wordnet'
```


## Usage

### Use from command-line

Generate sentence (`sent`) or document (`doc`) level noise samples for a text file as follows:
```
python -m artext -src source.txt -out output.txt -l sent -er 0.5 -n 10
```

[or] From source code using `inject.py` as follows:
```
python inject.py -src source.txt -out output.txt -l sent -er 0.5 -n 10
```

Use `-h` to see all options.


### Use as a library
```python
from artext import Artext

artxt = Artext()
artxt.samples = 5
artxt.error_rate = 0.25
sent = 'This is a sample sentence to be noised.'
noises = artxt.noise_sentence(sent)
print(noises)
```

## Examples


```
python example.py -er 0.5 -n 10
```
